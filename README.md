📘 Project: Building a Brain
📝 Overview


This notebook introduces the basics of neural networks by building a simple model that attempts to classify clothing images. It’s part of NVIDIA’s Deep Learning Institute (DLI) beginner-friendly learning material.


🔧 What it does

Loads a dataset of clothing images (like shirts, pants, shoes).

Builds a simple neural network from scratch (without using advanced frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras at first).

Trains the model to recognize clothing categories.

Evaluates accuracy compared to random guessing.

Visualizes weights, biases, and predictions.



📂 Main Sections

Setup – Import libraries and load dataset.

Neurons & Activation – Explains how artificial neurons mimic brain cells.

Forward Propagation – Calculates outputs from inputs.

Loss Function – Measures error between prediction and actual answer.

Backpropagation – Adjusts weights to improve accuracy.

Training Loop – Repeats multiple times to make the model learn.

Testing & Visualization – Tests on unseen data, shows predictions.



Conclusion – Explains that while the model is better than guessing, it’s still far from human-level performance.


🛠️ Technologies Used
